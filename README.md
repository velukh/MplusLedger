A World of Warcraft addon to help you track and analyze data about your Mythic+ runs. After you install the addon you can 
run the command `/mplus show` to see the ledger detailing information about your past M+ runs and your current M+, 
if applicable. Run `/mplus help` to see a list of all available commands.

**This addon IS NOT designed to track your progress or timer through a M+ that you're currently running. Please check out 
[Angry Keystones](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/angry-keystones) or [Gotta go Fast](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/gottagofast) 
if you are looking for this kind of functionality.**

## Installation Instructions

We recommend that you install MplusLedger through Curse. Otherwise you may download the source code directly in the Releases tab on 
the GitHub site and manually install the addon.

## Problems or Bugs

If you encounter any problems or bugs please submit an [issue to this repository](https://github.com/velukh/MplusLedger/issues) 
or if you do not have a GitHub profile you may also submit [an issue without a GitHub account](https://gitreports.com/issue/velukh/MplusLedger).

Please note that it is highly recommended that you use the GitHub issues directly as this is the only officially supported 
means to submit problems or suggestions and receive feedback from the developer. Additionally you will be able to sumibt 
iamges with your problem and that is highly recommended. The Git Reports link is merely a convenience to post issues on 
GitHub; if this link becomes abused or mistreated I may deactivate anonymous issue reporting altogether.  

**Any issue posted on any other service will not receive feedback from the developer.**

I'd like to add to the addon over time.
