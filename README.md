A World of Warcraft addon to help you track and analyze data about your Mythic+ runs. After you install the addon you can 
run the command `/mplus show` to see the ledger detailing information about your past M+ runs and your current M+, 
if applicable. Run `/mplus help` to see a list of all available commands.

**This addon DOES NOT track your progress or timer through a M+ that you're currently running. Please check out 
[Angry Keystones](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/angry-keystones) or [Gotta go Fast](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/gottagofast) 
if you are looking for this kind of functionality.**

## Installation Instructions

Until the addon has hit a 1.0 phase it will not be available through Curse and manual installations from GitHub will 
be required. If you check out the [Releases](https://github.com/velukh/MplusLedger/releases) page you can get a zip 
file of the current version. You can then copy/paste this folder into your Addons directory and you should see MplusLedger
in your list of addons.

## TODOS

There are many things I'd like to add to MplusLedger and plan to do so as time permits. Below is the list of items that 
we'd like to add to the addon over time.

- [ ] Drastically improve the UI to improve experience and amount of information displayed
- [ ] Add ability to store a player and party's gear set, talents, and buffs when a M+ starts
- [ ] Add a supplemental website to upload and backup your MplusLedger data
